The algorithm:
	- It uses prepared statement because there's data that has an apostrophe
	- It will read the first row to get the attributes
      - according to the position of the attributes, 
        it will insert the tuples base on its position.
	- it will also check whether a data is String/float/int
	- Used bufferedReader because it is much faster than Scanner		

-city.csv = It is splitted from the Team.csv (original file).
-conference.csv = splitted from the ranking.csv (ori) there are only
                  two conference east & west.
-team.csv = Not much change from the table itself. But it is taking foreign
		key from city(cid) and conference(conf_id) tables.
		Added a team name originated from the ranking.csv(ori) file.
		
-gameData.csv = 
	there are some errors in the gameData table, so we need to edit some 
	of it.
  	The error: even though the game and the date is the same, it has a 
		     different statistics and it doesn't make sense.

-compete.csv = It is splitted from the players.csv (ori).
		   Its indicating which seasons and teams the player has played in.

-player.csv = taking the name of the players and give each people
		  a unique_ID. Splitting the Data from players.csv

-season.csv = splitting the season values from the players.csv.
		  The season between each original file is incosistent.
		  There are more seasons in the games.csv(ori) compared 
		  to the season in players.csv(ori). So, we decided to
		  use the smaller season (2009-2019) in order to avoid
		  NULLS. Also, season is a weak entity since the year itself
		  can't determine anything. So, we use foreign key from players
 		  table.

-generate.csv (relation) = combine the game_id and team_id from the games.csv


-leaderboard.csv = we remove home record and away record because there's 
			 a lot of empty spaces and similar values.
		       We don't need team name and conference because 
                   it is already splitted on another table.
			 We decided to remove some of the rows because
			 we want to have the same year as the other tables
			 (2009-2019).
